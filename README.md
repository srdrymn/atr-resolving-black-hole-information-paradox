## The Core Claim

The black hole information paradox — the 50-year conflict between general relativity and quantum unitarity — is addressed by identifying the event horizon as a **dynamic rendering boundary**: the surface where the local algorithmic complexity of a mass condensation exceeds the holographic Bennett-Landauer processing limit. The system responds by compressing the interior data into a 2D holographic boundary, storing the detailed information in the unrendered Singleton backend.

Hawking radiation is reinterpreted as the **thermodynamic exhaust** of the universe's operating system slowly decompressing this stored data, at the Landauer-minimum rate: each Hawking quantum carries exactly **one nat of entropy** at the minimum energy cost $k_B T_H$.

Global unitarity is preserved because the underlying Singleton $|\Omega\rangle$ is unchanged — information is not destroyed, only rerouted between the rendered (spatial) and unrendered (backend) representations.

## What This Script Verifies

The script performs **10 independent checks**, spanning algebraic identities, astrophysical examples, a dynamic graph simulation, and a four-paper unification identity:

| Check | Description | Result |
|:-----:|-------------|:------:|
| 1 | Bekenstein bound = Holographic bound at $r = r_s$ | ✅ Exact identity |
| 2 | Independent derivation of Hawking temperature from $T = (\partial S/\partial E)^{-1}$ matches Hawking's formula | ✅ Exact (15 d.p.) |
| 3 | Each Hawking quantum carries exactly 1 nat of entropy | ✅ $\Delta S / k_B = 1.000$ |
| 4 | Total emitted entropy = initial BH entropy (unitarity) | ✅ Exact |
| 5 | Event horizon emerges from bandwidth overflow (graph dynamics) | ✅ Complete disconnection |
| 6 | Bekenstein-Hawking area law $S \propto A$ from graph dynamics | ✅ $S/r^2 \approx \text{const}$ |
| 7 | Page-like curve from finite-bandwidth evaporation (lattice roughening) | ✅ Rise → peak → fall |
| 8 | Evaporation timescale $t_{\text{evap}} \propto M^3$ | ✅ Exponent = 3.0000 |
| 9 | Holographic overflow at $r < r_s$ for astrophysical black holes | ✅ All 4 cases |
| 10 | Four-scale Bennett-Landauer unification identity | ✅ $a_0^2 = (8\pi G/3)\rho_\Lambda$ |

### Key Numerical Results

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| $S_{\text{Bek}} / S_{\text{BH}}$ at $r = r_s$ | $1.000000000000000$ (exact identity) |
| $\Delta S$ per Hawking quantum | $k_B$ (1 nat — exact) |
| Evaporation time (10 $M_\odot$) | $6.619 \times 10^{77}$ s ($2.1 \times 10^{70}$ years) |
| Sgr A* BH entropy | $2.318 \times 10^{67}$ J/K ($2.423 \times 10^{90}$ bits) |
| Page-like curve peak | Step 5 of 30 (boundary edge count rises then falls to near-zero) |
| Graph horizon | 136 interior nodes, 0 boundary edges (perfect disconnection) |

## The Simulation: Growing an Event Horizon

The centerpiece of this script is a **dynamic spatial graph** that demonstrates how an event horizon emerges from algorithmic thermodynamics alone — no general relativity, no horizon conditions, no metric:

1. **Build the lattice:** A 12×12×12 cubic grid of nodes (spatial degrees of freedom) connected by nearest-neighbor edges.
2. **Inject mass:** Data packets are injected into a central cluster of nodes, increasing their processing load.
3. **Enforce bandwidth:** Each node has a strict throughput cap (the Bennett-Landauer limit). When a node's load exceeds its cap, it drops external edges and connects only to other overloaded nodes.
4. **Watch the horizon form:** The overloaded nodes spontaneously disconnect from the exterior grid, forming an isolated interior clique — a computational event horizon with zero boundary edges.
5. **Evaporate:** Gradually reducing the interior data load causes boundary nodes to reconnect, and the boundary edge count traces a Page-like curve.

> **Transparency note:** The Page-like curve in Check 7 arises from **lattice roughening** — randomly evaporating boundary nodes creates a rough, pitted surface with higher boundary edge count than a perfectly smooth sphere of the same radius. The curve is a discrete geometric effect. It demonstrates that the correct qualitative shape (rise → peak → fall) is reproduced by this mechanism, but it does not constitute an independent derivation of the quantum Page curve or of von Neumann entanglement entropy.
